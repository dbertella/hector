<div>
Hector is a little dinosaur  
who lives in the forest.  
He spends all his days eating flowers  
and having a rest.
</div>

![page 1](../images/page1.png)

<div>
But you see, poor Hector  
is very, very slow.  
Flowers are not so tasty,  
but what else could he eat?
</div>

![page 2](../images/page2.png)

<div>
One day, he finds a carrot.  
Looking around him he wonders:  
“Is there anyone who might steal my food?”  
Hopefully no one.
</div>

![page 3](../images/page3.png)

<div>
“Hi Bunny. How are you?”  
“Hi Hector, not eating flowers today?”  
“I was just about to try this carrot”, replies Hector.  
“Interesting”, the bunny says, thinking for a minute...
</div>

![page 4](../images/page4.png)

<div>
“Hey! You’re eating my carrot!” cries Hector.  
“Sorry, you’re too slow.  
Didn't you know?  
Carrots are my favourite food.”
</div>

<div>
Later, on top of a rock, he’s searching:  
“What else could I eat?”  
Something sweet and juicy, he’s thinking.  
But can you see it?
</div>

![page 6](../images/page6.png)

<div>
Oh look, an apple!  
That must be good.  
Can you see anyone  
who might steal his food?
</div>

![page 7](../images/page7.png)

<div>
“Hi Bear. How are you?” asks Hector.  
“I’m hungry”, says Bear.  
“Me too!” replies Hector.  
“Let’s see who can get this apple first then”, says Bear.
</div>

![page 8](../images/page8.png)

<div>
“I thought a bear’s favourite food was honey?…”  
But Bear is already eating the apple.  
Hector has been too slow again.
</div>

![page 9](../images/page9.png)

<div>
He walks some more and... oh look, a salad!  
That must be good.  
Hopefully no one will steal his food.  
Who else might want this salad?
</div>

![page 10](../images/page10.png)

<div>
“Oh, hi Snail. How are you?”  
“I’m very hungry”, says Snail slowly.  
“I see”, replies Hector, “shall we share then?”  
“Sure, but you better hurry!”
</div>

![page 11](../images/page11.png)

<div>
Hector wants to run.  
But he’s very, very slow.  
Just a few more steps.  
But the snail is getting closer.
</div>

![page 12](../images/page12.png)

<div>
Hector moves another foot.  
But the snail is much faster.
</div>

![page 13](../images/page13.png)

<div>
“Don’t finish it: we can still be friends!”  
tries Hector one more time,  
desperately...
</div>

![page 14](../images/page14.png)

<div>
Once again, Hector was too slow.  
There’s nothing left,  
the salad is gone,  
and there’s no more food around.
</div>

![page 15](../images/page15.png)

<div>
When a little mouse  
comes to offer him a nut.  
“I’m small and fast, I can give you this and more.  
You’re big and strong, you can be my protector.”
</div>

![page 16](../images/page16.png)

<div>
Hector is not alone anymore,  
he is so happy!  
Hopefully no one will steal his new friend.  
Can you see anybody?
</div>

![page 17](../images/page17.png)

<div>
Oh no, a fox! “This mouse looks yummy.  
Do you mind if we share it?” asks Fox.  
“Well”, answers Hector, “if you want it  
You’ll have to do something for me.
</div>

![page 18](../images/page18.png)

<div>
Mice are my favourite food,  
but I think those nuts taste much better.  
Go! I hold the mouse, you try the nut.  
Right behind you, tell me, is it tasty?”
</div>

![page 19](../images/page19.png)

<div>
“Did you just play a trick on me?” grumbles Fox.  
“Where is the mouse, I want to know!”  
“I’m sorry”, Hector answers the Fox,  
“I ate it all, you’re far too slow!”
</div>

<div>
That was the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
</div>
