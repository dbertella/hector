Hector is a little dinosaur  
Who lives in the forest.  
He spends all his days eating flowers  
And rest.

---

But you see, poor Hector  
Is very very slow.  
Flowers are not so tasty  
But what else could he eat?

---

One day, he finds a carrot.  
Looking around, him he wonders:  
“Is there anyone who might steal my food?"  
Hopefully no-one.

“Hi Bunny. How are you?"  
“Hi Hector, not eating flowers today?"  
“I was just about to try this carrot", replies Hector.  
“Interesting", the bunny thinks for a minute...

---

“You’re eating my carrot!" cries Hector.  
“Sorry, you’re too slow.  
And everyone knows that carrots  
Are my favourite food."

---

Later, on top of a rock, he’s searching  
“What else could I eat?"  
Something sweet and juicy, he’s thinking.  
But can you see anything?

---

Oh look, an apple!  
That must be good.  
Can you see anyone  
Who might steal his food?

“Hi Bear. How are you?" asks Hector.  
“I’m hungry", said the Bear.  
“Me too!" replies Hector.  
“Let’s see who can get this apple first then", says Bear.

---

“I thought bears’ favourite food was honey?…"  
But Bear is already eating the apple  
Hector has been too slow again.

---

He walks some more and... oh look, a salad!  
That must be good.  
Hopefully no-one will steal his food.  
Who else might want this salad?

---

“Oh, hi Snail. How are you?"  
“I’m very hungry", says Snail slowly.  
“I see", replies Hector, “shall we share then?"  
“Sure, but you better hurry!"
![page 11](../images/page11.png)

---

Hector wants to run.  
But he’s never been too good at running.  
Just a few more steps.  
But the snail is getting closer.
![page 12](../images/page12.png)

---

Hector moves another paw.  
But the snail is much faster.

---

![page 13](../images/page13.png)

“Don’t finish it: we can still be friends!"  
Tries Hector one more time  
Desperately...

![page 14](../images/page14.png)

---

Once again, Hector was too slow  
There’s nothing left  
The salad is gone  
And there’s no more food around him.
![page 15](../images/page15.png)

---

When a little mouse  
Comes to offer him a nut.  
“I’m small and fast, I can give you more.  
You’re big and strong, you can protect me."
![page 16](../images/page16.png)

---

Hector is not alone anymore  
He is so happy!  
Hopefully no-one will steal his new friend  
Can you see anybody?
![page 17](../images/page17.png)

---

Oh no, a fox! “This mouse looks yummy  
Do you mind to share with me?" asks the fox.  
“Well", answers Hector, "if you want it"  
You’ll have to do something for me.
![page 18](../images/page18.png)

---

"Mice are my favourite food  
But I think those nuts taste much better"  
"Go! I hold the mouse, you try the nut  
Right behind you, tell me, is it tasty?"
![page 19](../images/page19.png)

---

“Did you just play a trick on me?" says Fox.  
“Where is the mouse, I want to know!"  
“I’m sorry", Hector answers the Fox  
“I ate it all, you’re too slow!"
